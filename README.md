This repository contains the code for the task 3 of GCE June 2019 as written by my Student <b>ENEMBE Verine ICHUMBEI</b> and Supervised by me, <b>Theophilus WABA NASALI</b>
<h2>Stating the problem</h2>
The student is expected to implement in a Programming Language(PL), a program to fill an NxN two-dimensional array in spiral pattern. The student is expected to show proof of modularity by implementing four procedures:
<ul>
  <li>FillRowForward(A, top, left, right, z)</li>
  <li>FillRowForward(A, top, left, right, z)</li>
</ul>
